This Challenge gives me an opportunity to work with some core concepts of Data science such as building programming logic, Data extraction from web/API, Data munging, Statistical Analysis.

The Ipython Notebook-1, illustrates the code for the first problem in which I have to determine the moves of the Knight in a chess game if Knight is itting on number 0 if we imagine a phone dialing pad and we have to determine the sum of keys for all allowable moves for the specified no of jumps.

The Ipython Notebook-2, illustrates the code for the Analysis of the San Fransisco house assessment Data from 2007-2015.
